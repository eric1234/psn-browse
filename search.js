Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker\'s plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow\'s fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon\'s death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets. \\n \\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan—a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength—intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker\'s return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents\' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young\'s Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan. \\n \\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy\'s help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc\'s lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc\'s lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy\'s plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment. \\n \\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum\'s visitor center where the Joker\'s applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon\'s defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building\'s roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker—who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.","summary":"Critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham Asylum returns with a remastered Game of the Year Edition, featuring 4 extra Challenge Maps.

Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne\'s dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison\'s criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence \\"Protocol 10\\", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10.\\n\\nThere, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker\'s blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease. Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin.\\n\\nTracking Penguin to the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute, Batman defeats his forces, his imprisoned monster Solomon Grundy, and ultimately the Penguin himself, before liberating Mr. Freeze. Freeze tells Batman that he has already developed the cure, but its instability renders it useless. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra\'s al Ghul\'s blood can complete the cure. Batman tracks one of Ra\'s al Ghul\'s assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra\'s and his daughter Talia, Batman\'s former lover. With Ra\'s al Ghul\'s blood, Freeze is able to develop an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it.\\n\\nWhen he returns to the Joker, Batman finds him restored to health. While the two fight, Strange activates Protocol 10, which is revealed to be a scheme to wipe out the entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. The TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham\'s denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker can take advantage of the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman\'s life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker.\\n\\nBatman infiltrates Wonder Tower and disables Protocol 10. Ra\'s al Ghul is revealed to be the true mastermind behind Arkham City and mortally wounds Strange for failing to defeat Batman. With his dying breath, Strange activates \\"Protocol 11\\", the self-destruction of Wonder Tower. Batman and Ra\'s escape, but Ra\'s commits suicide rather than risk capture. Joker contacts Batman, threatening to kill Talia unless Batman meets him at the Monarch Theater. Once Batman arrives, Joker demands the cure but is stabbed and apparently killed by Talia while distracted. Talia admits to stealing the cure from Quinn, when she is killed by a second Joker, still stricken with the disease. The healthy Joker that Talia stabbed then reanimates into the shapeshifting Clayface, who is revealed to have been masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain\'s request.\\n\\nBatman incapacitates Clayface, but Joker blows up the theater floor, sending Batman plummeting into Ra\'s\' lair below. Batman destroys Ra\'s\' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it, and drinks a portion of the antidote. Batman debates curing his foe but is attacked by Joker before he can act, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker\'s body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.","summary":"After the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), a section of the city of Gotham has been turned into a prison, designed to keep the scum of the city away from the people.

In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The squad winds up trapped in a civilian\'s car when it plunges into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and critically wounded, gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield.[35] Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup d\'état, and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie, an amphibious assault carrier en route to China\'s eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible.\\nGarrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah\'s husband. With Tombstone\'s help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac\'s protests, Irish leads them to the Valkyrie. Aboard the Valkyrie, they head for the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the Titan, the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Chang\'s Chinese military. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader (Recker lost the position because he didn\'t stop Irish in Shanghai), to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah\'s husband and Garrison.\\nGarrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish\'s chagrin, as he wasn\'t involved in the debrief himself. They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them.\\nRecker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by \\"Dima\\", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrive and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié, who had been posing as her husband. The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima.\\nForced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she\'d brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang\'s army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the Valkyrie. They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal.\\nThey are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the Valkyrie, which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang\'s forces. Tombstone assists in clearing the deck of boarding Chinese forces and find Garrison, who is holed up with Jin Jié, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore, and escaped by \\"crawling through a thousand miles of shit with a hole in [his] stomach\\"). When Chinese forces finally reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Jié convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Jié had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Jié calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to them. The Chinese soldiers celebrate the news of their leader\'s return and call off the attack.\\nHowever, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the Valkyrie with his warship, hoping to \\"bury the truth and everyone with it\\". With no ordinance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah once again volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship\'s blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker—and the player—is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang\'s warship obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Jié; or to send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang\'s ship but killing whomever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with \\"no fucking regrets\\".","summary":"Battlefield 4 is the genre-defining action blockbuster created by Dice, and made from moments that blur the line between game and glory, moments found only in Battlefield.

As one progresses through the six worlds in Braid, storyline text at the beginning of each world provides further insight into Tim\'s quest for the princess, and alludes to the overarching gameplay mechanic of each level. The themes evoked include forgiveness, desire, and frustration. The final level, in which everything but Tim moves in reverse, depicts the princess escaping from a knight, and working together with Tim to surpass obstacles and meet at her home. Tim is suddenly locked out of the house, and, as time progresses forward, reversing Tim\'s actions, the events show the princess running from Tim, setting traps that he is able to evade, until she is rescued by the knight. Tim is revealed to be the \\"monster\\" the princess is running from.\\nFollowing completion of the game, the player finds additional texts that expand the story. The ending of the game is purposely ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations. One theory, based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb—\\"Now we are all sons of bitches\\"—is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development.[20] Some also refer to the name of the game as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time, demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game. Journalists have considered Braid\'s plot to be interwoven with the game itself, much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work\'s construction. In this sense, some have considered the game to carry a simple credo, such as \\"You must look back to go forwards\\" as suggested by Eurogamer\'s Dan Whitehead. Others have likened Braid to punk rock, designed (as explicitly stated by Blow) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts, such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros., and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design. Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story; he \\"would not be capable\\" of explaining the whole story of the game in words, and said that the central idea is \\"something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly.\\"Blow considered Braid to be \\"about the journey, not the destination\\". He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game, seeing it as a way to provide \\"a longer-term challenge\\".","summary":"Braid is a puzzle-platformer, drawn in a painterly style, where you can manipulate the flow of time in strange and unusual ways. From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time\'s strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more.\\n\\nBraid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game.

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam\'s last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\\n\\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game\'s opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula\'s main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula\'s health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

At the same time, an army of demons invade the city, putting everyone, including Nero\'s love interest Kyrie, in danger. Tasked with stopping Dante by Kyrie\'s brother Credo, the Captain of the Holy Knights, Nero\'s journey leads him to discover that he is in fact a descendant of Sparda himself, and Dante is not his enemy. Under orders from Sanctus, Agnus, has been siphoning the power of the long lost Devil Arm Yamato, the sword of Dante\'s brother Vergil, to create a demonic army, and imbue high-ranking members of the Order with demonic power. To Agnus\' shock, the shattered Yamato restores itself in Nero\'s presence, and flies to Nero\'s aid. With The Order\'s plans revealed, Agnus flees to inform the newly resurrected Sanctus.\\n\\nAs Nero sets his sights on The Order, he discovers to his dismay that Credo is part of the conspiracy, until he ends up being deceived as well when they witness Kyrie being kidnapped by a newly revived Sanctus. He intends to use a creature known as Savior to defeat the demon army he\'s created, as a means of strengthening the people\'s worship of Sparda. With the Sparda Sword already in his possession, and needing the blood of a descendant of Sparda along with the Yamato, Sanctus captures Nero to power The Savior\'s core. Dante arrives, with Trish, who was revealed to be a spy within The Order, and makes a promise to the dying Credo to save Nero and Kyrie. Splitting up, Trish evacuates Fortuna\'s human residents, while Dante destroys all the Hell Gates scattered over Fortuna, and defeats Agnus, reclaiming the Yamato sword for the last time. Confronting the Savior in a sky battle above Fortuna, Dante drives the Yamato through The Savior\'s chest, where Nero recovers it inside, freeing himself and Kyrie, and defeating Sanctus.\\n\\nNero is able to make peace with the power it has given him to protect those he cares about. Before Dante leaves, he decides to entrust Nero with the Yamato, and Kyrie and Nero share their first kiss in the ruins of Fortuna. Back at Dante\'s office, Lady arrives.

Along the way he meets Raspberyl who introduces herself as an old friend of Mao and the Academy\'s Number 1 Delinquent (as she does all her homework, has perfect attendance and volunteers in her spare time). Soon after, the pair meets Almaz who has come to protect the Princess from the Overlord. Mao, seeing Almaz\'s title as \\"Hero\\", kidnaps him while Beryl tries to rescue him. Eventually Mao gets away with Almaz as class starts and Beryl cannot be late. Mao then takes Almaz into his heart where they can switch titles thus giving Mao the power he needs to defeat the Overlord (he then comments how economical the game is as the final boss will be defeated in the first chapter). Mao and his slaves, including Almaz who is now a \\"Demon-in-training\\", then go face the Overlord who is much bigger than they expect. The fight actually occurs without the Overlord\'s knowledge on the palm of his own hand and the party is thus defeated.","summary":"Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice is the third video game in the Disgaea series by Nippon Ichi.

By completing story missions, some characters are added and can be played as without starting a new game, meaning all acquired weapons, items and materials will be kept.\\n\\nThe chosen character can be customized in various ways. Apart from the main weapon, one sub weapon, chosen from many weapon types, can be equipped. Both weapons can be switched anytime during battle, to accommodate the situation. A new addition is the Chi system which allows to set special abilities to the character, there are four slots to equip Chi (the two arms and legs). Weapons can also be customized by adding Orbs that give different abilities, such as elemental properties.\\n\\nIn the village, the player can exchange materials, buy weaponry, items for use in battle, Chi skills and Orbs. Some NPC\'s may appear in the village, some giving materials or items, or Officer cards, which can be set to help the Village\'s growth. Over time, better items can be acquired from the shops.\\n\\nBy talking to the quest board or the Guard at the village\'s gate, main Missions or Requests can be chosen. Each battle is a series of small maps where various enemy soldiers and weaponry are fought, eventually leading to the commander of the enemy army. The goal of each battle can vary, some are classic goals like \\"Defeat the Commander\\" and some, less battle oriented, like \\"Retrieve all treasure boxes\\". In addition, there also are bonus missions that require the player to defeat a particular unit, reaching a certain point before a certain time, etc. Each bonus mission gives extra experience points upon completion.\\n\\nOther new additions to the battle system are the possibility to have aerial battles, and the main feature of the game: the Fury Mode, unleashed when the Fury gauge (replacing the traditional Musou gauge) is full. The furied character has better stats and move sets, and can unleash the infamous Musou attack to deal some extra damage.\\n\\nTo add to the surreal look of the game, some new bosses are actually massive beast-like weapons, and usually require the help of other players to defeat them.

Finally, after the bloodiest war in history, EDF blasted the last Ravager off the planet.\\n\\nWe thought that was the end of it. It had to be. But now, eight short years later, humanity\'s worst nightmare has come true: What we\'d faced had only been the first wave. The Ravagers are back, with new enhanced creatures and machines.

This story begins with the end of the world.","summary":"For the last twelve months, we’ve had our heads down working hard on Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and it’s really exciting to be able to share some more information with you as well as a new trailer.\\n\\nIf you already know The Chinese Room, you’ll know that we make story-driven games. Creating a rich, deep world with strong drama and exceptional production values is key to what we’re all about. Rapture is set in a remote valley in June 1984 and is a story about people and how they live with each other. But it’s also about the end of the world.\\n\\nRapture is inspired by the fiction of John Wyndham, J. G. Ballard, John Christopher and other authors who deal with ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. There’s a very particular English feel that we wanted to capture in the game, a combination of the epic and the intimate. Rapture also came from our obsession with post-apocalyptic gaming, and the simple idea that whilst we normally play as the hero, in reality, most of us would be the piles of ash and bone littering the game world. That’s an interesting place to start telling a story.\\n\\nOur approach is to create a game that you can utterly immerse yourself in. Yaughton Valley, where Rapture takes place, is a living, breathing world. The world of Rapture is not just a backdrop; it’s a character in its own right. It’s great working with PS4 as its processing power makes a game like this possible for a team our size.\\n\\nThe game is all about discovery. It’s open-world so you have the freedom to explore wherever you like, visiting areas in an order you define, and the story is written to allow this whilst making sure every player has a strong dramatic experience. It’s a type of storytelling that is completely unique to games. The choices you make as a player have a direct impact on how you understand the story – the more you explore and interact, the deeper you are drawn into Rapture’s world.","themes":["Science fiction","Drama"],"studio":"The Chinese Room","release_date":"2015-08-11","rank":80.10783434389428,"content_descriptions":["Alcohol Reference","Blood","Strong Language","Suggestive Themes","Violence","Bad Language"]},{"id":24969,"artworks":["arvad"],"cover":"co2xgn","genres":["Platform","Adventure"],"keywords":["retro","side scroller","2d","sci-fi","action-adventure","multiple endings","alien planet","exploration driven"],"name":"Exile\'s End","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"storyline":"\\"In the far future, a massive corporation called Ravenwood controls commerce on Earth and on numerous other worlds across the galaxy.

Among the members of this team is Jameson, an old soldier with a dark past he’s trying to forget.\\n\\nJust as the ship carrying Jameson and his team arrives, it experiences a catastrophic electrical failure and crash-lands upon the planet’s surface, with Jameson the only apparent survivor.

sequence introduces the player to their character\'s father James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character\'s deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of \\"the waters of life\\".\\n\\nThe main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of \\"The Lone Wanderer\\". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player\'s father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine\'s death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player\'s character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.\\n\\nAfter investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault\'s sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project\'s control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel.\\n\\nWith Project Purity still inoperable even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James\'s work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.\\n\\nAt the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden\'s orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden\'s office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic \\"purity\\" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel.\\n\\nWith the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.","summary":"Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created. Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future.\\n\\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.","themes":["Action","Science fiction","Survival","Sandbox","Open

A former professional wrestler and street fighter turned newly-elected mayor, named Mike Haggar had made a personal vow to the public from within his past campaign in that he would help clean up the streets of both crime and violence so that the citizens of Metro City could finally gain the peace and happiness that they had sought and wanted for so long. \\n \\nThe Mad Gear Gang: the most powerful and dominant criminal organization of Metro City\'s criminal underworld, sees Haggar as a potential threat to their own violent rule of the city, which causes the gang to create and initiate an immediate plan of action so that they could make sure and see to it that Haggar himself doesn\'t get in the way of their own criminal activities. While in his office one day, Haggar receives an unexpected phone call from a suspicious sounding man who tells him that his young daughter, Jessica has been kidnapped by Mad Gear and he also warns Haggar that unless he doesn\'t want anything bad happening to her, he\'ll let the gang do as they please like the last mayor did before him. Upon knowing and realizing the dire threat at hand, Haggar wastes no time in meeting up and informing both his daughter\'s boyfriend Cody and his sparring partner Guy about the entire situation, which causes Cody and Guy to know and realize the fact that they can\'t allow Mad Gear to get away with this and that the two of them personally vow to aid and help Haggar out in saving Jessica and defeating Mad Gear. \\n \\nFrom there, the trio of Haggar, Cody, and Guy head into the streets of Metro City to bust Mad Gear\'s skulls, fighting their way through the hordes of goons littering the city and also battling against the top ringleaders of Mad Gear, which includes the Caribbean thug Damnd, the American Japanophile Sodom, the corrupt cop Edi. E, former Red Beret and militia leader Rolento, and the ill-tempered Abigail. After fighting and battling against all of Mad Gear from within their rescue mission, Haggar, Cody, and Guy soon confronts the Mad Gear\'s boss and leader, the crooked businessman Belger from upon the top floor of a large building which serves as Belger\'s penthouse apartment. After a tough and intense final fight, Cody knocks Belger out of the window with a strong uppercut punch, sending him falling to his death below while Jessica is rescued and saved from the current danger, culminating with Cody and Jessica sharing a passionate kiss with each other as the young couple are emotionally happy to be reunited with one another after the entire ordeal. \\n \\nThe original Japanese version of the Final Fight intro states that the game takes place in 1989, and provides the corresponding ages and birthdates for each of the main characters. The English language version changes the setting to \\"Sometime in the 1990s...\\" and only provides the birthdates for the characters. The English translation featured in Final Fight One reverts back to the original 1989 date. \\n \\n \\n \\nMagic Sword: \\nA long time ago, a powerful sorcerer known as Lord Drokmar was seduced by the dark powers of the Black Orb, who promises eternal life to its wielder, and attempted to cover the world in darkness to create a lightless hell on Earth. A brave warrior of light, however, stopped his plans and confined the demon inside the 50-floor tall Dragon\'s Tower. For unknown reasons, however, the brave warrior was unable to fully destroy the Black Orb at the time. \\n \\nNow, suddenly the Black Orb has returned to its master, and Lord Drokmar has ressurected from within the tower alongside an army of ghouls and demons from Hell. The influence of his magic spreads across the lands as Drokmar resumes his plans to capture all light within the Black Orb and rule over a darkened world. The hopes of the inhabitants once again rests on a brave warrior determined to fight against the armies of Hell throughout the 50 floors of the Dragon\'s Tower, defeat Drokmar and shatter the Black Orb once and for all.

An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.\\n\\nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder\'s mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.","summary":"Progress is made through the game by fighting through Death Adder\'s henchmen, including men armed with clubs and maces, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \\"bars\\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue \'magic potions\' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.\\n\\nVarious steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","themes":["Action","Fantasy"],"studio":"Team Shinobi","release_date":"1989-01-27","rank":84.03233462379809,"content_descriptions":["Violence","Blood"]},{"id":23472,"artworks":["arcer"],"collection":"Goosebumps","cover":"co217j","genres":["Puzzle","Strategy","Adventure"],"keywords":["fantasy","mummy","game show","adventure","horror","steam","puzzle","steam achievements","licensed game","coin","real photos on cover art","playstation trophies","first-person perspective","games based on literature","werewolves","full motion video","samsung gear vr support","young protagonist","slime monster","refrigerator","live-action cutscene","book tie-in","severed limbs","scarecrow","goosebumps; goosebumps; scary; horror; rl; stine; blood; gore; story,"],"name":"Goosebumps: The Game","summary":"The walk home from school today is going to be a lot spookier than usual… Your sleepy neighborhood’s been overrun by monsters!

After the battle was won and the Raven Lord defeated, the sword was left in the mortal world, becoming the center of wars over its power. The fighting made the sword lust after the life of its users, eventually killing them after a short time. A warrior tribe finally took charge of the sword, ending the wars and pledging to keep it safe and unused for the world\'s own good. Among the tribe, a legend said that the sword\'s original wielder would be reborn in the year of the \\"fire-horse\\", and that this figure would unite the world\'s scattered tribes and lead the world to peace.","summary":"The gameplay of Heavenly Sword resembles a martial arts title focused on melee combat while featuring opportunities for ranged attacks. The main character, Nariko, uses a weapon called the \\"Heavenly Sword\\" which changes into one of three forms depending on what attack stance the player uses as part of a unique fighting style. Speed Stance provides an even balance between damage and speed, where the sword takes the form of two separate blades. Range Stance allows fast, long-range, but weaker attacks, with the sword being two blades chained together. Power Stance is the most powerful, but slowest style, where attacks are made with the Sword in the shape of one large, two-handed blade.\\n\\nFor exploration and certain battles, the game also makes use of \\"quick time events\\" (QTE). During a QTE, a symbol for a certain button or for an action such as moving the analog stick to the right or left appears on screen and the player must match what is shown to successfully complete the scene.\\n\\nIn addition to Nariko, a secondary character, Kai, is controlled for some portions of the game. Many of Kai\'s stages take the form of sniping missions, using her crossbow to pick off enemies, in some cases to protect characters. While Kai cannot perform hand-to-hand combat, in stages that call for her to explore the level she is able to hop over objects and to free herself from an enemy\'s grasp by temporarily stunning them.\\n\\nProjectiles can be maneuvered to their targets using the motion-sensing capabilities of the SIXAXIS controller through a feature known as Aftertouch. Such projectiles include guiding Kai\'s arrows after she has launched them, and for Nariko, guiding a cannon or rocket launcher, or picking up and throwing objects.","themes":["Action"],"studio":"Ninja Theory","release_date":"2007-09-12","rank":80.80094514096278,"content_descriptions":["Blood","Language","Suggestive Themes","Violence","Violence"]},{"id":982,"artworks":["arpkd"],"collection":"Heavy Fire","cover":"co4291","genres":["Shooter"],"keywords":["shooter game","action,...","heavy fire: afghanistan®","heavy fire: afghanistan® game"],"name":"Heavy Fire: Afghanistan","player_perspectives":["First person"],"summary":"Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is a super fast playing on-rails shooter set in modern-day Afghanistan featuring tanks, assault vehicles and helicopters.

Each district has an elevated train system and a separate power grid. The premise of the game is built around the partial destruction of the Historic District by a mysterious explosion, followed by a viral epidemic that forces federal authorities to seal the only bridge leading to the mainland. A rise in violent crime overwhelms the police, resulting in societal collapse.\\n\\nCharacters\\nThe protagonist is Cole MacGrath (Jason Cottle), a courier who is accused of triggering the explosion, which leaves him with the ability to absorb and project electricity. His closest friend, Zeke Jedediah Dunbar (Caleb Moody), allows Cole to hide on his rooftop, despite his envy of the former\'s powers. Trish Dailey (October Moore), Cole\'s girlfriend, abandons him out of anger over the death of her sister Amy, while most of Empire City\'s residents view him as a terrorist. While attempting to escape the city with Zeke, Cole is contacted by FBI agent Moya Jones (Kimberli Colbourne), who offers to clear his name if he helps her find her husband, fellow agent John White (Phil LaMarr). White vanished while investigating a group known as the First Sons, who are believed to be responsible for orchestrating the explosion.\\n\\nWhile working to restore order in the Neon District, Cole encounters Sasha (Jessica Straus), a former member of the First Sons, who like Cole is a \\"Conduit\\", an individual given powers by the First Sons. Using her ability to control the minds of others via a tar-like substance, she has formed a gang known as the Reapers. Meanwhile, the Warren has been overrun by the Dust Men, an army of homeless militants led by Alden Tate (also Jason Cottle), the original leader of the First Sons, who possesses telekinesis. Kessler (Sam A. Mowry), the true antagonist of the game, is a shadowy figure who controls the First Sons and who takes an obsessive interest in Cole and his powers.\\n\\nStory\\nWhile the basic story of InFamous remains unchanged whether the player opts for the \\"Good\\" or \\"Evil\\" karma path, there are some story elements that change depending on Cole\'s choices.\\n\\nWhile making a delivery in the Historic District, Cole is instructed to open the package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling six city blocks and nearly killing him. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after he is accused of triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the sealed bridge, only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, who persuades him to return and find John. With her help, Cole restores the district\'s power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but she is abducted by the Sons before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists what remains of the police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke\'s incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch things up and confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. Giving in to his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler.\\n\\nWith Alden on a murderous rampage towards the Historic District, Cole defeats him once and for all in a bridge battle. Before jumping in the water, Alden reveals that Kessler exiled him from the First Sons. White, who turns out to be an NSA agent with no connection to Moya, reaches out to Cole and explains that the Ray Sphere is designed to consume bio-energy from thousands of lives and transfer it to a single user, making them a Conduit. During their search for the Sphere, Kessler publicly challenges Cole to stop a series of bombings across the district, ending with him being forced to choose between saving Trish or her colleagues. Regardless of which choice he makes, Cole fails to keep Trish from dying. Determined to punish Kessler, Cole tracks the Sphere to a remote pier, where he must decide whether to destroy it or use it to become even more powerful. Regardless, the Sphere releases the last of its energy, killing John before disappearing into a vortex.","summary":"inFAMOUS is a single player open-world action/adventure game that places you in the role of Cole McGrath, a once regular guy who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers.

Before they can depart for Wolfe\'s lab in New Marais, the Beast attacks Empire City. Cole tries to fight him off, but even his most powerful attack proves useless. The group is subsequently forced to flee as Empire City is completely and utterly destroyed.\\n\\nArriving in New Marais, Cole and his allies learn that energy magnate Joseph Bertrand III (Graham McTavish), an anti-Conduit demagogue, has seized control of the city. Aware of Wolfe\'s intentions, Bertrand has his private army, the Militia, destroy the doctor\'s lab. Rescuing Wolfe, Cole learns that he has developed the Ray Field Inhibitor, a device capable of stripping Conduits of their powers. Before he can help Cole locate the energy cores needed to power the RFI, he is killed by the Militia, who also take Kuo captive. While working to free her, Cole and Zeke meet Roscoe Laroche, a Vietnam veteran who leads a resistance movement opposed to Bertrand, and Nix (Nika Futterman), a Conduit with the ability to manipulate and ignite a black, napalm-like substance, who has been waging war on the Militia.

Their initial attack was defeated by a small group of ISA peacekeeping forces.\\n\\nIn the months that followed, the ISA slowly succeeded in driving the remaining invaders off Vekta – but not before the retreating Helghast troops captured a powerful nuclear weapon.

The two are taken to a room where the captured Jason Narville\'s execution is about to be broadcast by Stahl across Helghan. As the two soldiers are about to execute Narville, they reveal themselves as Tomas \\"Sev\\" Sevchenko and Rico Velasquez and the scene cuts back six months earlier, immediately following the events of Killzone 2.\\nSev and Rico regroup with Captain Jason Narville outside Scolar Visari\'s palace and they begin their evacuation towards the remaining ISA ships on Helghan. They face heavy resistance from organised Helghan troops led by Admiral Orlock, whose battle plan is well received by most of the senate except for Jorhan Stahl, the chairman of Stahl Arms, the largest weapons manufacturer on Helghan. From the outset, the animosity between the two parties is made apparent. Rico receives a transmission from Jammer and separates from the group to rescue her squad who have encountered heavy resistance. Due to a poorly-engineered evacuation a few ISA ships are unable to depart, separating Rico from Sev and the rest of the ISA forces, and leaving all of them marooned on Helghan.\\nJumping six months forward, the Helghast senate expresses their disappointment with Orlock\'s search for the remaining ISA forces, since he had initially promised that they would be dead within the hour. One of the senators suggests to relieve Orlock, and replace him with Stahl, but is refused. As a result Stahl refuses to deliver his weapon prototype and other resources (Stahl Arms itself) to the military as long as Orlock is on charge, citing the Admiral as incompetent. Stahl organizes his private army to hunt down the ISA who are hiding in a Helghast jungle. Narville dispatches Sev along with a soldier named Kowalski to retrieve a satellite uplink in order to contact the Vektan government. Upon doing so, Earth Command informs Sev and Narville that the ISA has agreed to a cease-fire and that they are to surrender so their release can be negotiated. The Helghast soon track the ISA in the jungle, ending with their capture and the death of Kowalski after a brutal battle.\\nRico and his men, including Jammer, who have been separated from the main group for six months, are able to rescue Sev, who convinces them to save Narville and the rest of the captured ISA forces. They track them to Stahl\'s base and discover a horrifying new weapon using irradiated Petrusite, a compound that causes its victims to explode. Disguised as Narville\'s executioners, Sev and Rico rescue Narville in addition to freeing some of their men who were held as prisoners of war and used as test subjects for Stahl\'s new weapons. On their way out, Rico and Sev discover Stahl\'s plan to destroy Earth, the most powerful military force and the leading imperial force which colonized all the other worlds; their downfall would allow the Helghast to dominate and reclaim all the other colonies.\\nEmbarrassed by Stahl\'s failure to execute Narville, the senate chooses to vote Orlock as Helghan\'s new Autarch and he orders Stahl to transfer his new weapons to the Helghast military. Stahl is made to confront Orlock at the space station where he plans to assassinate Stahl. After a grueling ground battle with the Helghast forces, remaining ISA soldiers arrive at the orbital elevator and use it to ride up to the space station.\\nOn the station, Stahl turns on Orlock, destroying his fleet and murdering him after a brief duel, and makes preparations to bombard Earth. The remaining ISA forces hijack two fighters and Sev manages to shoot down Stahl\'s cruiser. Unwilling to let Stahl escape the cruiser, he drops a nuke on the falling cruiser, detonating the Petrusite weapons it was carrying above Helghan\'s atmosphere. The Petrusite engulfs the entire planet and wipes out almost everything on its surface. Jammer then reports that Helghan has gone dark, with not a single communication being heard. Sev contemplates on the many lives on the planet obliterated by the Petrusite.\\nIn a mid-credits scene, two Helghast soldiers are searching through some ruins when they come across an escape pod. Though the occupant\'s identity is not revealed, both soldiers bow and say, \\"Welcome home, sir,\\" implying that Stahl survived and managed to escape his cruiser before it was destroyed.","summary":"Visari is gone, but the war is far from over. Helghast forces have mounted a devastating counter-attack, prompting the ISA evacuation of planet Helghan. As new Helghast battalions with more powerful weapons appear, the ISA find themselves outmanned, outgunned and surrounded. The player reassumes the role of Sev, a surviving member of the Special Forces unit Alpha Squad, who must fight against vindictive, merciless enemy forces in a desperate attempt to escape Helghan alive.","themes":["Action","Science fiction","Warfare"],"studio":"Guerrilla Games","release_date":"2011-02-22","rank":85.08825433254601,"content_descriptions":["Blood and Gore","Intense Violence","Strong Language","Violence","Bad Language","Online Gameplay","Violence","Crime"]},{"id":1937,"artworks":["gmyj6jhrwd23t6lrn8kc","uqfmz1s3fo2wspgijrtr","iirxekjdyucpxpfy8yz3","fqqzdkp3rrfsvgtn3vce","q9iurwwff6pz1mb2huan","ygpubehmdlwp2nwubnw4","r8cfqdpexhbal6a0hlt7","jx6bp4xcaskdy73e3prg","h9q5rxcyhifcjyiclsjm","healgfcdz6ibcoogzap9","sqqyu4t7umf3cb2xuoiz","qkrer4wxu1ikykqnulss"],"collection":"Killzone","cover":"co1v40","franchises":["Killzone"],"genres":["Shooter"],"keywords":["mech","invasion","first person shooter","fps","hellghast","guerilla","military","robots","sci-fi","online","ship","good vs evil","playstation network","explosion","machine gun","throwing weapons","playstation trophies","60 fps on consoles","knife","helmet","rocket launcher","motion blur","pistol","assault rifle","saving the world","full body awareness","kill feed","gloves","real-time combat","final boss","audio logs","pax prime 2013","gamescom 2013","reloading","e3 2014","mercenary","sniper rifle","level titles","cover system","the future","multiplayer scoreboard","high dynamic range","tokyo game show 2013","grenade","linear gameplay","dlc season pass","chest-high walls","space nazis","fascism","zip line","helghast","difficulty description","dropship","flying car","killzone"],"name":"Killzone: Shadow Fall","player_perspectives":["First person"],"storyline":"Killzone: Shadow Fall is set 30 years after the events of Killzone 3.

Combat is handled in a RTS fashion, with the player- and AI-controlled forces moving on an overhead battle screen and executing commands in real time. The battles occur between medium-size parties led by individual characters with unique attributes and personalities. These leaders also receive experience, level up, and learn magic spells in a RPG fashion. The game\'s structure and pacing are also reminiscent of an RPG rather than an RTS: there is no base-building or resource management, and the missions involves completing fairly linear stages that consist chiefly of combat and plot-advancing dialogue.","studio":"TWIM","release_date":"1995-12-31","rank":0},{"id":52577,"artworks":["arz4x","arz4y"],"cover":"co3irh","genres":["Puzzle"],"keywords":["puzzle","playstation plus","mahjong solitaire","mahjong tile","torque 2d","mahjong tales: ancient wisdom","mahjong tales: ancient wisdom game"],"name":"Mahjong Tales: Ancient Wisdom","summary":"Playstation Network title, developed and published by TikGames / Creat Studios.","studio":"tik games","release_date":"2008-12-24","rank":0},{"id":7062,"artworks":["nyufkfv6nerwdhmjzfkw","qz7kptn0f1figajvisur","mlamli3xtljggaxq59oa","jvyelggpgojbhepjgnwv","ifskkiecmvckmcckb0b8","kj7nbrakvn6r2io7k2yp","mdyb7hv0k1vbw8dr5dzu","arz4z","arz50"],"cover":"co2chx","genres":["Platform","Puzzle","Adventure"],"keywords":["stealth","magic","fantasy","health","fire","puzzles","bridge","action-adventure","dodge","achievements","teleportation","talking animals","fruit","switch","boss fight","jump","crate","alternate costumes","leveling up","voice acting","ladder","explosives","slime","armor","helmet","crouching","cutscene","save point","team-up attacks","treasure chest","slashing weapons","auto-aim","environmental puzzles","teleporter","column","boulder","exploding barrel","stone","catapult","destructible environment","healing food","healer","gauntlets","games that ask you to \\"press start\\" but will accept other buttons","multiple enemy boss fight","ledge grab","flashback","finishing move","vent crawling","fire manipulation","alert","enemy distraction","hidden treasure chest","lightning manipulation","air manipulation","corruption","life drain","push to talk","e3 2010","gamescom 2009"],"name":"Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom","summary":"In Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom, a once thriving society is suddenly engulfed by a dark force that nearly eradicates all of its inhabitants.

It is told in legend that the King of Gallowmere\'s champion, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led his army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before succumbing to his mortal wounds. In reality however, Dan was in fact struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle, with the king choosing to cover it up and declare Dan the \\"Hero of Gallowmere\\". Zarok, meanwhile, was forced into hiding and was presumed dead. 100 years later, in 1386, Zarok reappears, casting a spell over Gallowmere to awaken his undead army and steal the souls of the living. However, in the process, he unwittingly revives the corpse of Dan, who has over time become a skeletal corpse, missing his jaw and the eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere. Having been unable to ascend to the Hall of Heroes due to his failures in life, Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.\\n\\nAs Dan travels across Gallowmere, fighting his way through Zarok\'s hordes and confronting all manners of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok\'s lair, fighting off Zarok\'s skeletal warriors using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices. After also managing to defeat Zarok\'s champion, Lord Kardok, Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but Dan manages to defeat him. As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse, Dan escapes and Zarok\'s magical influence over the land is thwarted, restoring the souls back to the living and putting the dead back to rest. With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber. If the player has managed to collect all the Chalices, Dan will ascend to the Hall of Heroes, where is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.","summary":"The game takes place across a variety of levels, many of which require certain objectives to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many of these weapons can be charged for a powerful attack and some weapons, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his own arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons to defend against attacks; though they can only take several hits of damage before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties; green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.\\n\\nDan\'s health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that can replenish Dan\'s health and fill up any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player fills it with enough souls from defeated enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a legendary hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the game\'s true ending is revealed.","themes":["Action","Fantasy","Horror","Historical","Comedy"],"studio":"SCE Cambridge Studio","release_date":"1998-10-09","rank":89.21046356078395,"content_descriptions":["Animated Blood","Animated Violence"]},{"id":1723,"artworks":["slojleiqvifc5gl4lqwu"],"collection":"Mega Man","cover":"co200f","franchises":["Mega Man"],"genres":["Shooter","Platform"],"keywords":["robot","cyberpunk","disease","side scroller","2d","health","platformers","death","fire","futuristic","scrolling","sci-fi","shooter","side-scrolling","multiple protagonists","multiple endings","pixel art","platformer","sequel","high score","action game","8-bit","spikes","boss fight","truck","sprite","boss rush","challenges","playstation trophies","extra life","protagonist\'s name in the title","shopping","transforming boss","deliberately retro","unlockables","bubble","playstation plus","ice stage","checkpoints","instant death","deliberately retro box art","robot protagonist","downloadable content","underwater gameplay","shielded enemies","final boss","chiptune","mini-boss","ice","moving platforms","the future","wii classic controller support","misrepresentative box art","xbox one backwards compatibility","non-standard difficulty differences","charge","multiple enemy boss fight","noscon","plot twist","sideways wii remote gameplay","knee sliding","giant enemy crab","robot masters","met","slideshow cutscene","playstation 3","freezing weapons","damage shield","fictional currencies","super suit","fodder enemies","copy ability","yashichi","monomyth","enemy spawner","easy mode","on disc dlc","quicksand","ps3","mega man 10","mega man 10 game"],"name":"Mega Man 10","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"storyline":"In the year 20XX, an outbreak of a robotic-virus known as the \\"Roboenza\\" runs rampant across the globe, infecting and disabling robots, hampering daily life for humans.

One month after the outbreak, several infected robots become berserk and attempt to take over the world. One day, Dr. Wily appears in Dr. Light\'s lab with his capsule damaged and asks for help. Mega Man saves Wily from crashing and Wily says that Roboenza-infected robots attacked his spaceship and stole the parts to a medicine-making machine he had been working on to cure the virus. Mega Man agrees to retrieve the stolen parts from the eight Robot Masters. Before he begins, Proto Man arrives to help Mega Man, believing the job to be too big for just one of them and the two join forces to acquire the cure. \\n \\nAfter taking down four Robot Masters, Dr. Wily presents what he claims is a prototype cure for Roll and asks if Mega Man is feeling Roboenza symptoms, to which Mega Man says he\'s feeling fine. After the last one is defeated, Mega Man comes down with Roboenza and is nearly incapacitated as Dr. Wily reveals that it was him behind the disease and that all robots who want the cure must serve under him. Roll gives her sample of the cure to Mega Man, who recovers and goes after Wily.

Since Dr. Wily\'s last defeat, the Blue Bomber has seen peace return. \\n \\nJust when people forgot all about Dr. Wily, robots all over the world began going crazy. It soon became apparent that these robots were those created by Dr. Light. As phone calls came pouring into Light\'s lab, Dr. Wily interrupted all television programs to announce that these robotic riots were not his doing. He then continued to show video evidence that proved Dr. Light\'s involvement in the recent violent outbreaks. To make matters worse, Wily gave the account number to his personal bank account and announced that he would accept donations to build his own robot army to counter that of Light\'s. Mega Man quickly volunteered to clear Light\'s name and was sent out to investigate the source of the problem. \\n \\nBefore long, the police came to Light Labs to arrest the good doctor, but Light went along quietly to prove his innocence. Meanwhile, Mega Man went after the Robot Masters and, after he defeated a few of them, discovered that they were scheduled to be decommissioned and sent to the junkyard because they had reached the expiration date assigned to them by the government. Once the final Robot Master had been taken down, Mega Man brought back one of the robot\'s internal memory units to Auto for investigation. As it turned out, Dr. Wily had reprogrammed the robots, who were scheduled for demolition, to rise up against their human masters rather than be destroyed. All the robots wanted to do was have a purpose, and they certainly did not want to be sent to the scrap heap. \\n \\nAfter they had viewed the video, Dr. Wily burst into their lab and stole the memory circuit and then withdrew to his newly constructed Wily Castle. Mega Man made his way through the fortress, fighting powerful robots built with the money Wily received from donations from those concerned with the robot uprisings. In the end, Mega Man defeated Wily once again, and showed him footage of every single defeat he had dealt Wily. Although Wily seemed contrite and apologetic, he tricked Mega Man into thinking that Dr. Light was, in fact, imprisoned in a jail cell in the next room. Although Proto Man warned him that it was a trap, Mega Man went to investigate the cell and was electrocuted by the Dr. Light decoy that was in the cell instead. As Wily\'s lab self-destructed, Proto Man returned and teleported Mega Man out of the lab just in time. \\n \\nIn the end, Light was released from prison. He then found useful purposes for all of the Robot Masters he had designed, which had reached their expiration dates. \\n \\nAlthough the ending states that Dr. Wily was nowhere to be found after the destruction of his base, the credits show Concrete Man chasing him.","summary":"Mega Man 9 brings the series back to its old school roots with retro gameplay, music and classic 8-bit style graphics! \\n \\nMega Man fans, your wait is over!

As the story develops, more is revealed about Jen\'s past and her relationship with her boyfriend, as well as the nature of the demon worlds.\\n\\nIn Primal, the player can control either Jen or Scree as they navigate the realms of Oblivion. As the game progresses, newer demonic forms are obtained, which prove invaluable in solving various puzzles and combat.\\n\\nControl can be switched between Jen and Scree at any time in game. When in control of one, the other will be operated by AI, performing various functions depending on the situation. During play, the characters can interact with one another, performing actions such as asking questions, or siphoning energy.\\n\\nWhen in control of Jen, the player may transform into one of four demonic forms for various purposes, depending on the situation (provided the forms are unlocked). When in a demon form, Jen experiences a boost in attack, defense, speed, attack range and access to abilities unavailable in a human form. The tattoo on Jen\'s back also glows when in a demon form, corresponding to various forms.\\n\\nDefeating enemies involves weakening enemies to the point where their hit points reach zero, at which time a finishing move must be performed to kill the enemy. While the moves differ in style and time taken, the final effect remains the same. Enemies can be finished off before the health bar reaches zero, and doing so leaves more residual energy.\\n\\nWhile Jen can remain in a demonic form indefinitely, taking damage will reduce health. However, hit points here are represented by demonic energy. When an enemy is killed, the remaining energy can be drained through use of Scree, who can store the energy for when it is needed. Jen can then call on the energy, siphoning it off to replenish her own. Scree can store a vast amount of energy, but also has limits as to how much.\\n\\nWhen in control of Scree, the player is invulnerable; Scree, being a gargoyle, cannot suffer damage, making him an effective scout. Scree is capable of climbing on stone walls, a necessary ability when traversing the realms. Scree can also store drained energy from dead enemies, which can be used to replenish Jen\'s demonic health, though he must remain immobile when doing so.\\n\\nScree is revealed to be the long-lost Abdizur, who disappeared following an encounter with the lord of Chaos. In Solus, for a temporary amount of time, the player possesses a life-size statue of Abdizur via Scree, to combat Belhazur when Jen\'s powers are not fit to do so. The player may also possess other statues in an area under given circumstances.\\n\\nThe player may also happen across various energy crystals, which can be stored and used if Scree\'s energy reserves are not enough and the player is at low health. These crystals are kept throughout the game, the only exclusion being when revisiting previous scenes, at which point they are reduced to a default amount. This means that the crystals function as extra lives, to a degree.\\n\\nIf Jen is in human form, her health replenishes automatically if she is not in battle (human form only; demon energy must be replenished by either drawing on Scree\'s reserve energy or, failing that, by using a crystal). While in human form, Jen\'s health represents her presence in the demon world. If she loses all her health while in human form, she is returned to the human world, where she is in a near-death state. When this happens, the player must direct Scree to the nearest rift gate within a time limit (not seen on screen, though the voice of Arella warns the player that time is running out). If Scree does not reach a rift gate in time, Jen dies, and the game is over.\\n\\nThroughout the game, constant saving can prove onerous, particularly if the player wishes to backtrack and revisit certain areas. Provided a save game is present, the player may do so, and can revisit nearly all of the locations, once they have been unlocked via an in-game cutscene.","themes":["Action"],"studio":"SCE Cambridge Studio","release_date":"2003-03-25","rank":87.02834305757321,"content_descriptions":["Blood","Violence"]},{"id":19885,"artworks":["arhpj","arz8r"],"cover":"co3j3j","genres":["Simulator","Strategy"],"keywords":["simulation"],"name":"Professional Farmer 2017","summary":"Get ready for the rural lifestyle!

Survivors come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, while the wastes are plagued by various bandits clans, and mutants, who attack all normal humans in a voracious horde.\\n\\nIn 2135, former U.S. Marine Lieutenant Nicholas Raine emerges from an underground shelter called an Ark, 106 years after being put into stasis. These underground shelters are the direct result of the Eden Project, a massive international undertaking in which hundreds of Arks, containing cryogenic pods, were sealed under the surface of the Earth to preserve enough of the human population to rebuild civilization after the asteroid collision. The Eden Project was far less successful than hoped, as Raine\'s Ark in particular was heavily damaged, with all of its other residents dead and equipment destroyed, and he wakes up alone with no specific goal in mind.\\n\\nRaine enters the surface, where he is immediately attacked by bandits but is saved by Dan Hagar, a local wasteland settler who brings Raine to his settlement. Hagar informs him that a powerful technologically advanced organization known as the Authority, that considers itself the one true government of the wasteland, is hunting for Ark survivors for an unknown purpose. Raine briefly aids Hagar\'s settlement and others in the local area by completing a few small jobs, and during this time it is revealed that the nanotrites injected into Raine\'s blood before he was sent into hibernation have granted him superhuman abilities to help him survive the harsh environment, but have made him valuable to the Authority. Hagar believes Raine\'s continued presence is too dangerous for the settlement and sends him to the nearby town of Wellspring instead.\\n\\nIn Wellspring, Raine helps the town with various problems such as fighting off bandits, mutants, and ferrying supplies. Eventually, he comes into contact with Dr. Kvasir, an elderly scientist who previously worked for the Authority, who tells Raine about the inhumane experiments they were responsible for, such as the creation of the mutants. Kvasir puts him into contact with the Resistance, an armed anti-Authority group, where he is tasked with rescuing their leader, Captain Marshall, who has recently been imprisoned by the Authority. Raine again attracts attention from the Authority, forcing him to flee Wellspring and join the Resistance at their headquarters in Subway Town, where he earns the trust of the town and its tyrannical mayor, Redstone. He also learns what had happened in the past century from Captain Marshall, who is an Ark survivor himself. General Martin Cross, who was in charge of the Eden Project, sabotaged the operation shortly before 99942 Apophis struck the Earth by ensuring that only the Arks with people loyal to him were opened on schedule, with this first wave of Ark survivors eventually forming the Authority. The remaining Arks were supposed to stay underground forever in hibernation, including Raine\'s Ark, which surfaced only because its systems were damaged and it automatically rose to protect any surviving inhabitants.\\n\\nWith the Authority beginning to forcefully expand its influence on the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act with the help of Raine who can recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way to do this is to transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.","summary":"Rage is a first-person shooter set in the not-too-distant future after an asteroid impacts Earth, leaving a ravaged world behind.

Nefarious attempts to access Clank\'s memory banks for the key to something called the Orvus Chamber but is not allowed to do so because of the Zoni. Nefarious then sets free his Hypersonic Brainwave Scrambler, causing the Zoni to flee and a blackout to occur. When the power is restored, Clank has awoken and attempts to escape, but is caught by Nefarious and his butler, Lawrence and promptly immobilized. \\nClank awakens later to find himself with a robot named Sigmund who is the Junior Caretaker of the facility, with no sign of Nefarious and his troops. Through the use of stations called mnemonic chambers that tap into his memory banks, Clank learns that the Great Clock was constructed by the Zoni scientist Orvus as a means to heal damage to the universe caused through excessive misuse of time-travel. A portion of Orvus still resides in Clank\'s memory banks, put there when Clank was constructed by the Zoni so that one day Clank would be able to take up the mantle of Senior Caretaker, with the help of the Zoni. Clank also learns that his father left for an outpost on Zanifar and never returned to the Clock. \\nMeanwhile, Ratchet and Qwark explore the Breegus System for information on Clank and Nefarious. They learn of an \\"exile\\" that is also fighting Nefarious, and trace the being down to another Lombax, General Alister Azimuth. While exploring Krell Canyon for an Obsidian Eye to talk to Clank, Azimuth tells Ratchet he knows of his parents and that it was his fault that Emperor Tachyon was able to come to power, having shared the Lombaxes\' technical genius with him. When the Lombaxes left for another dimension, Azimuth was forced to stay behind as punishment for his \\"crimes\\". Azimuth also tells Ratchet about the Great Clock, and that they may be able to use it to bring back the Lombaxes to this universe. After speaking to Clank through an Obsidian Eye and saving Qwark from a war grok named Snowball, Ratchet uses a time portal on Zanifar to find out what happened to Orvus. Nefarious captured the Zoni to try and get into the Orvus Chamber, but failed after Orvus vanished into thin air. Ratchet managed to make his escape and save Azimuth from Nefarious\'s henchman, Lord Vorselon. (But not before altering Nefarious\'s appearance by giving his past self a permanent scar on his right eye) \\nRatchet and Azimuth manage to free Clank from another group of Nefarious\'s henchwomen, the Valkyries. Clank then manages to persuade Ratchet that Azimuth\'s plan to use the Clock would inevitably destroy the universe, prompting Azimuth to leave sadly. Ratchet, Clank & Qwark then launch a stealth mission aboard Nefarious\' base, but are eventually caught. Before launching Ratchet and Clank on an asteroid into deep space, Nefarious reveals that he plans to use the Great Clock to go back in time to foil the various heroes across the universe and create a present where villains always reign supreme. Ratchet and Clank\'s asteroid crashes into a nearby planet (Planet Morklon) though the two are unharmed due to the Zoni protecting them. They see the world they landed on was destroyed. A surviving fongiod named Yurik reveled this was cause by the Agorians ten years ago and told the story of the battle of Gimlick Valley. One day Agorians suddenly attacked the peaceful village and captured many Fongiod villagers. The tribe leader and an army of soldiers were put together to fight, only for the tribe leader to get killed and the Agorians destroyed the dam wiping out the Fongoid village. They use a similar time portal from Zanifar to rescue the Fongoids of the past ten years ago to the battle of Gimlick valley. They enter combat with Agorians saving child Yurik who tells Ratchet to save the prisoners. After freeing the prisoners with help from the Fongoids, they confront Commander Argos, an Agorian general who was piloting his ship. The duo destroy the ship as it sinks into the dam. Fongoids cheered in victory and then the duo returned to the present where they see a different more peaceful village of Gimlick valley. Where the duos surprise are giant hedges memorial of the duo and is the 10 year anniversary of the day the duo save the Fongiod village. The duo meet with a Fongiod who they ask to borrow the memorial ship that Argos used during the battle that apparently has been recovered and repaired since it fell into the dam. The duo return to Nefarious to face him again before he can reach the Clock. They are able to defeat him aboard his ship, but Lawrence manages to slip away in the escape pod as the ship veers off course towards Nefarious\'s base. Just as the ship is about to impact, Azimuth arrives to rescue Ratchet and Clank. As the duo run towards Azimuth\'s ship, Nefarious\'s ship crashes into it and destroys the base. \\nThe group returns to the Great Clock, where Clank is ready to resume his duties. However, Ratchet & Clank both refuse Azimuth the chance to use the machine to bring back the Lombaxes. Azimuth suddenly snaps, furious that Ratchet no longer wants what he does. His ambition turns to corruption and he fires his weapon at Ratchet, knocking him over the edge of the platform and killing him. While Clank manages to give chase to the General, Sigmund tries to stop him, but Azimuth overpowers him, and then Clank locks himself in the Orvus Chamber to prevent Azimuth from getting in. Remembering the words of The Plumber that he wouldn\'t risk any more than 6 minutes, Clank initiates a time shift to go back in time six minutes, where he is able to push Ratchet out of way of Azimuth\'s blast and alter the events. Ratchet and Azimuth then race though a grind rail to get into the Orvus Chamber. The duo are too late and Azimuth activates the Clock to shift backwards to try to bring the Lombaxes home. Ratchet then fights Azimuth with the fate of the entire universe in the balance. As he and Ratchet fight, the Clock starts to fall apart around them, unable to take the strain of such a massive shift. As Ratchet shouts at him to stop what he\'s done, Azimuth realizes his mistake. He tells Ratchet to \\"take care of himself\\" and gives his own life to stop the Clock from self destructing by using his wrench to replace the broken lever and turning it. However, by doing it, he gets hit by a lethal energy blast from the broken Clock and dies. \\nAfter the Zoni repair the chamber, Ratchet bids Clank a farewell, wishing him well as he walks away. Clank, hearing the recorded words of Orvus again, realizes he cannot stay because he cannot leave Ratchet until he finds his family since Ratchet\'s actions helped find Clank\'s home. Clank promotes Sigmund to Senior Caretaker and, as Orvus says in the background that his son can do whatever makes him feel whole as he rejoins Ratchet just as he\'s about to leave. Together, they soar into the stars for another adventure.","summary":"Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time (known as Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time in most PAL countries) is a platform game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 video game console.

Earth’s minerals are being depleted and humans need more of them to survive. The vast Ultor Corporation runs the mining operation on Mars. The living conditions are deplorable, human rights for the miners are few and a disease called \\"The Plague\\" is running rampant throughout the colony with no known antidote available - predominantly within the confines of the mine complex. Parker, a downtrodden miner, came to Mars to make a new start in his life - taken in by the promises and advantages Ultor has to offer in the mines of Mars.\\n\\nAfter a routine day in the mine with the typical aggression toward miners and cramped living conditions and poor nutrition, he witnesses the spark that starts a rebellion when a security guard abuses a miner at the end of his shift and heartlessly kills him. Parker takes up arms, with the help of Hendrix, a rebellious Ultor security technician who guides Parker through the complex. Hendrix tries to get Parker to join up with a group of miners who are about to steal a supply shuttle and escape the complex, but Parker arrives too late. The shuttle takes off, and is destroyed by missiles moments later.\\n\\nParker traverses through the Ultor complex, eliminating any resistance Ultor throws at him, and even (with the help of Orion, a high-ranking Red Faction member) kidnapping a high-ranking Ultor administrator, Gryphon, for Eos, leader of the Red Faction. Parker learns from Gryphon about Dr. Capek, who created \\"The Plague\\". Capek has been experimenting with nanotechnology, and the Plague is a side-effect of injections at the miners\' annual medical checkup. Hendrix directs Parker to Capek\'s secret underground laboratory, where he and Eos meet up and take down Capek. As Capek dies, he tells Eos there is a cure for the Plague but refuses to tell her how to make it and bluntly states \\"Hope you all Die!\\" With Capek dead the lab\'s self-destruction sequence initiates, Eos stays behind to find the files on the cure while Parker continues to the Communications center.\\n\\nAfter sending a distress call to the Earth Defense Force Parker destroys the missile defense system, so that he can stow away on a shuttle to an Ultor space station in Martian orbit to deactivate a laser defense system without getting shot down. After destroying the space station, Parker lands back on Mars via an escape pod, Ultor brings out its reserve of mercenaries to help them in their fight against the miners. Hendrix tells Parker that the mercenaries have orders to destroy the mining complex, covering up any proof of Ultor\'s wrongdoing, Hendrix is killed soon after this by the mercenaries.\\n\\nAfter fighting his way through the mercenary base, Parker confronts Masako, the mercenary leader. After he kills Masako, Parker sees that Eos is tied up and sitting on the floor next to the bomb, which has been set to explode. After deactivating it, the Earth Defense Force arrives just in time to save Parker and Eos from a fighter aircraft. Eos tells Parker that an antidote for the Plague has been made and it is being given to any sick miners. She also tells him she is leaving Mars, and that Parker should enjoy his new status as a hero.","summary":"Red Faction revolutionizes gaming with Geo-Mod technology, the ability to completely alter and destroy the environment in real-time.

While on work detail, Dan testifies about the Earth Defense Force\'s (EDF) cruelty to the Martian people and asks Alec to join the Red Faction, of which Dan is a member. Dan is soon after gunned down by air support from an EDF assault team. Alec is rescued by Red Faction guerrillas and reluctantly becomes a freedom fighter for the group alongside avid inventor \\"Sam\\" Samanya, rambling psychotic Randy Jenkins, and commander Hugo Davies(although in the game known as RF commander) Between Davies\'s command and Alec\'s skill and bravery, the EDF are quickly driven out of the sector known as Parker.\\n\\nThe campaign against the EDF continues in the Dust sector, and Alec is eventually assigned to routine surveillance of the Marauders, a mysterious and violent warrior tribe living in the inhospitable Badlands, in hopes of recovering stolen weapons. Alec tracks them to an abandoned Ultor base that promptly comes under massive assault from the EDF. During the fracas, Alec escapes with a device called the Nano Forge. This brings attention to Admiral Kobel, commander of a powerful warship called the Hydra, along with General Roth, commander of the EDF forces on Mars, who declares Alec Mason an outlaw. General Roth turns his attention to Dust and the EDF responds by pulling out of the sector and ordering the artillery base in the Free Fire Zone to bomb Dust into oblivion. Alec is tasked with saving members of the Red Faction and intel on the EDF from the bombardment, which he succeeds in doing.\\n\\nAlec temporarily loses faith in the movement, citing that no matter how determined their efforts are, the EDF will simply bomb them to submission. However, Sam analyzes the Nano Forge and discovers it can create catastrophic nanites that can disintegrate any object. She builds a prototype rifle from the device and entrusts it to Alec\'s care.\\n\\nAfter determining a series of blind spots in its coverage a successful run against an EDF artillery base commences, allowing the group to begin take the fight to EDF territories, The Red Faction prepares to launch a massive coordinated offensive against the EDF. Consequently, the EDF stages an assault against the Red Faction, resulting in the abortion of the offensive, the annihilation of the Badlands camp and the death of Commander Davies. Only Sam, Alec and a handful of other fighters survive the assault. They learn afterward that the Hydra is nearing Mars, with Kobel intending to use its firepower to put an end to the Red Faction and, if necessary, all planetary life. Sam declares that they need support from the Marauders if their campaign is to continue. When Alec remains dubious, she reveals that she was a Marauder herself. The pair head to a Marauder stronghold to meet with their ruler, Vasha, Sam\'s sister. Sam requests the usage of the Marauders\' particle accelerator technology, with plans to combine it with the Nano Forge, creating a weapon capable of destroying the Hydra. Vasha agrees to let the Red Faction use their technology in exchange for possession of the Nano Forge once the war is finished.\\n\\nAfter capturing a broadcasting station and using it to regroup the Red Faction, Sam and Alec lead the remaining Red Faction and Marauders on a final assault on EDF Central Command. The two groups converge on Mt. Vogel to assemble the machine, however a surprise EDF blitzkrieg led by General Roth wipes out the Marauders guarding the summit end of the accelerator and Vasha along with them. Alec storms the mountain with a modified missile-pod tank, defeating General Roth\'s army and killing Roth. Sam\'s plan succeeds and the accelerated Nano Forge is successful in vaporizing the Hydra. As the survivors of Mars celebrate, Sam declares the war over, but Alec responds that the EDF will return, stating \\"We\'ll be ready for \'em\\". Alec and Sam approach the crowds of civilians gathered, and Alec raises his hammer in the air, showing the sign of the Red Faction and their long-waited victory.","summary":"Set 50 years after the climactic events of the original Red Faction, Red Faction: Guerrilla allows players to take the role of an insurgent fighter with the newly re-established Red Faction movement as they battle for liberation from the oppressive Earth Defense Force.

With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to their role as an explosives expert (codenamed \\"Alias\\") as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth.\\n\\nEventually, the research is successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. However, fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down, executed, and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as \\"The Processed\\". Collectively betrayed by their leader, the player\'s squad flees underground and ally themselves with the Red Faction as mercenaries. The Red Faction at this point in the story is an organized resistance movement that is strongly opposed to the rule of Sopot and the skewed political tenets of The Commonwealth. The squad eventually pursues Sopot and neutralizes all opposition in their way as the Red Faction takes the conflict to the streets in a joint uprising against the rule of The Commonwealth. During the initial stages of the game, the Red Faction and the squad mutually support each other as they overcome shared objectives such as sabotaging propaganda installations. The uprising culminates in successfully trapping Sopot in his missile silo and executing him.\\n\\nAlias returns to the makeshift base of operations only to discover that all of the Red Faction resistance members present have been brutally slaughtered. The squad\'s leader, Molov, remarks that with Sopot dead and with the nanotech research in his possession, the Commonwealth\'s military forces have voluntarily pledged allegiance to him. He declares Alias and Tangier, a fellow squadmember, to be enemies of the state for supporting the Red Faction. Tangier helps Alias escape, and shortly after fleeing to safety, Alias lends aid to surviving Red Faction members who are defending themselves from the enemy. Alias and Echo, another squadmember, meet up in a secret location to discuss an alternate strategy to stop Molov, and Echo is killed in action during a firefight with Quill, a former squadmember. Tangier radios Alias soon afterward, and the two agree to shut down Molov\'s commandeered nanotech laboratory located within the colossal statue of Sopot. Inside the laboratory, Alias triumphs over Repta, a former squadmember, and destroys the nanotech laboratory\'s power generators. Alias\'s explosives weaken the foundation of the statue and render it unstable. Alias encounters Repta again and once again triumphs over him, causing the energy field within Repta to reach critical mass.\\n\\nAlias and Tangier meet up and pursue Molov, who is scaling Sopot\'s statue with the nanotech cell – the culmination of Capek\'s research – and awaiting extraction from Shrike, Molov\'s subordinate. Shrike betrays his commanding officer, and Tangier manages to reclaim the nanotech cell from Molov\'s possession. Molov, desperate to eliminate his enemies, climbs aboard a nearby battle armor and launches a frenzied assault against Alias. Using the destructible environment to his advantage, Alias manages to evade Molov\'s fire and launches a counterattack that not only kills Molov, but also destroys the statue. As the statue crumbles, Shrike swoops in with his close air support craft to extract Alias. From this point, the story ends in one of four possible ways, depending on the player\'s Heroics score.","summary":"In Red Faction II you will have to defend your country as Alias, a demolitions expert, with the help of your five squad members, each specializing in their own method of destruction.

Among them are a sniper, Sergeant Tyler \\"Razor Six-Four\\" Wells, for long range missions and stealth assignments, a Delta Force operator, Private Cole Anderson, as well as a rebel, El Tejon, for missions involving direct firefights. The main plot centers around a highly trained special ops unit that is sent into the fictional country of Isla Trueno, whose democratic government has been overthrown by a hostile force. \\n \\nUndercover CIA Agent Mike Rodriguez infiltrates the entourage of General Vasquez in order to set up a shot for the sniper-spotter team Alpha Nine. Killing the general would put an end to the regime on Isla Trueno. During the assassination attempt, Agent Rodriguez is compromised and captured, and General Vasquez escapes. After a series of missions, the assault team Delta Three, supported by sniper unit Razor Six Four, manages to free Agent Rodriguez from an enemy camp. \\n \\nWith Vasquez on the loose, Delta Three and Razor Six-Four are sent to set up an air strike on a cocaine plantation. After the successful destruction of the plantation, the evacuation chopper comes under attack and has to leave. Razor Six Four makes his way through enemy territory in order to reach the new evacuation point from where he is extracted. \\n \\nAgent Rodriguez teams up with Sergeant Tyler Wells to steal plans of a nuclear warhead from an enemy camp. The mission is a success, but Agent Rodriguez turns out to be a traitor. He takes the data and leaves Sergeant Wells to be shot by the enemy. A rebel leader called El Tejon rescues Sergeant Wells, who then tracks down Rodriguez, kills him and retrieves the data. \\n \\nBecause the data files are incomplete, the Alpha Nine sniper-spotter team steals the rest of the data from the enemy. Together with Razor Six Four, Alpha Nine then eliminates Ernesto Salazar, General Vasquez\' advisor. Decryption of the stolen data uncovers the location of a secret uranium mine on Isla Trueno. Delta Three and Razor Six-Four enter the mine facilities in an enemy truck, free the civilian workers and destroy the compound. To fully dissolve the now weakened regime, a second attempt is made to kill General Vasquez. Razor Six-Four completes the assignment successfully, and the game ends the moment Vasquez is struck by the bullet.","summary":"The game is a tactical shooter played from a first-person perspective. As the title suggests, a large portion of the game consists of stealth, staking out targets and firing sniper rifles. Bullet trajectories are subject to wind, gravity and flight time, all of which players must account for when taking shots. To simplify this procedure, easier difficulty settings contain indicators that highlight enemies and show precisely where a bullet will hit. \\n \\nThe main weapons used in the game are silenced pistols, knives and various types of sniper rifles. In missions that are played with characters who are not snipers, the stealth aspect is dropped in favor of faster-paced \\"run and gun\\" scenarios. An exception to this are spotting missions, in which the primary objective consists of marking targets for a computer-controlled sniper character. \\n \\nMost of the game takes place in a dense jungle environment. Waypoint overlays at all times display the correct routes through the areas players must traverse. While these routes need not be followed exactly, the level design usually ensures an overall linear path due to obstacle placement and invisible walls. Many waypoints trigger scripted mission events, and some waypoints act as checkpoints, which automatically save the game. \\n \\nThe single player campaign of Sniper: Ghost Warrior is made up of four separate acts, each of which deals with a different conflict. All acts are split up into various missions, which usually depict the same event from different points of view. For example, in one segment players may be participating in an infantry assault on an enemy camp, while the next segment has them assuming the role of a supporting sniper who backs up the assault. There is downloadable content available for the title that seamlessly continues the story line with three additional campaign missions.","themes":["Action","Stealth","Warfare"],"studio":"City Interactive","release_date":"2010-06-24","rank":60.97171105292236,"content_descriptions":["Blood","Drug Reference","Strong Language","Violence","Violence","Bad Language","Online Gameplay"]},{"id":26937,"collection":"Soldner-X: Himmelssturmer","cover":"co3bbd","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"keywords":["robot","shoot \'em up","health","shmup","bullet hell","spaceship","arcade","sci-fi","shooter","side-scrolling","classic","missile","high score","flamethrower","spikes","shoot\'em up","boss fight","power up","health pack","coin","60 fps on consoles","extra life","bomb","unlockables","homing missile","vertical scrolling","infinite ammo","difficulty level","laser","lives","combo","rocket","leaderboard","auto-scrolling levels","boss assistance","bullet pattern","multiplier","continue","pulse gun","parallax scrolling","plasma beam","combo breaker","homing projectile","wave beam","soldner-x","soldner-x 2: final prototype","soldner-x 2: final prototype game"],"name":"SÖLDNER-X 2: Final Prototype","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"summary":"In Soldner-X 2: Final Prototype, you will return to Gota IV as part of the Soldner-X defense force.

Within lurks an evil unknown to man that bears a danger so much greater than any threat yet witnessed. A dark, mysterious power has manifested itself in the depths of the gas giant, absorbing life and technology, and assimilating all in its wake. Spacecraft, pilots, androids, and computers: Nothing is safe. No one can escape the virus that infects all life forms, turning once brave heroes and peaceful colonists alike into ravaging, chaotic forces, fighting each other and infecting more in the process. Soulless technology and hate-driven humanoids are all that\'s left of Earth\'s once-proud fleet. The galaxy as we know it is threatening to fall apart. War, death, and bedlam have taken hold of civilisation. Humankind is at the brink of extinction. Those who aren\'t yet infected--the resistance, a band of mercenaries, soldiers and civilians--are Earth\'s final hope, and they have one goal in common: To stop the deadly infection and destroy the core of all evil, hidden in the depths of Conceyta. Scouts have undertaken a merciless mission to bring detailed plans and data on the location of the power and its defence line in a last attempt to save humankind. So it has come to be that the last remaining pilot, a mercenary and bounty hunter, is the only chance of survival, ironically driven by the desire for wealth and fame. Left with little choice, the resistance has developed a star fighter capable of intercepting the evil force, equipped with a deadly weapon system and of utmost agility. With no time to lose, the 10th and final prototype of the ship is handed to the pilot. Its name: \\"Sldner-X\\". Should the pilot succeed, his name shall live on in the memories of man forever to come. And so the battle begins.","themes":["Action","Science fiction"],"studio":"SideQuest Studios","release_date":"2007-12-14","rank":0,"content_descriptions":["Fantasy Violence"]},{"id":9727,"artworks":["ar6wq"],"cover":"co2a20","genres":["Adventure","Indie"],"keywords":["robot","post-apocalyptic","blood","mystery","survival","shark","fire","keyboard","puzzles","sci-fi","bridge","adventure","water","horror","button","steam","backtracking","time limit","playstation","rock","atmospheric","paint","inventory","ball","newspaper","camera","survival horror","nudity","flowers","graffiti","glitch","hook","quiz","switch","scissors","darkness","tree","flags","steam achievements","single-player only","train","steam cloud","jump","male protagonists","crate","trash can","vine","pencil","plate","spoon","fork","cup","laboratory apparatus","countdown timer","playing cards","steam workshop","voice acting","toilet","sunglasses","toilet paper","ladder","fish","toothpaste","first-person perspective","famous quotes","cell phone","polygonal 3d","book","mouse","pipe","shower head","computer","syringe","door","frying pan","bed","shelf","aquatic","lily pad","knife","item throw","helmet","shrub","loading screens","bubble","crouching","wasd movement","message on the wall","white noise","first-person regain consciousness","color separation","gamma adjustment","cardboard box","paper","photo","letter","sink","houseplant","window","desk lamp","the locked door","non-player character","profanity","aural characters","gog.com","electricity","fake in-game advertising","table","elevator","bloody wall","mutilated corpse","warning sign","pillow","desk","corpse","scalpel","first aid kit","sprinting","key","bench","bone","french fries","instant death","glasses","bottle","laptop","moral decisions","crosshair","full body awareness","subtitles","pants","razor","vision obstruction","umbrella","maps","evade","tips","limited light source","crepuscular rays","laser","breakable glass","fake glitch","poster","operating an operating system","jump scare moment","triple question mark","office chair","couch","clock","bulletin board","sticky note","loud ambient noises","audio logs","inconvenient malfunction","phone","valve","rug","whiteboard","curtain","underwear","crab","map","functional toilets","production babies","light switch","level titles","television","mirror","refrigerator","bucket","clipboard","the future","water cooler","lens flare","cooking range","glass","confirm menu choices","coral","evolving title screen","boots","gasoline can","net","seashell","shoes","eye","reflection","necklace","fireplace","experiments gone awry","file cabinet","wrench","fan","hair brush","clothesline","projector screen","surveillance camera","car accident","electrified water","spaghetti","stalactite","plot twist","dumbbell","tape","rotatable objects","light bloom","fire extinguisher","locker","crane","magazine","drill","speaker","microwave","towel","code writing","toothbrush","oven","shirt","scripted events","vent crawling","in-game e-mail","x-ray picture","lock","first-person platforming","chalkboard","tin can","guided by radio","texture pop-in","leaning","air duct","vacuum cleaner","paint brush","sock","context sensitive","outside of the map","foreshadowing","stapler","crane puzzle","screwdriver","overall","soap","stingray","origami","ghostly manifestation","walls covered with organic tissue","marker","gin","flash drive","stun baton","debilitated movement","hpl engine 3","fire hose cabinet","slide projector"],"name":"SOMA","player_perspectives":["First person"],"storyline":"The radio has gone silent on PATHOS-2.

One of the people left behind was U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad (a reference to the author of Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad), a founding member of Delta Force, who refused to evacuate from a training facility in the city and instead remained behind with the men under his command to help protect the citizens that could not evacuate.\\n\\nAfter several weeks of no contact, the Army fears that Col. Konrad and his men are lost to the destruction of the city until a weak distress signal is picked up. This gives the Army reason to deploy the player and their squad, who must infiltrate the city, neutralize outlaws and survive sandstorms as they attempt to determine what happened to Konrad and his men. Through the narrative in the trailer and sound clips from the game\'s website it is hinted that Konrad may not have entirely genuine motivations for remaining in Dubai against orders.","summary":"A third-person shooter in which three American soldiers led by Capt. Walker are sent to Dubai in order to recover whoever remains of an infantry unit, the 33rd Battalion, until they decide to take action against the militants situated in the city.

Once at the village, Kate learns that the woman who owned the factory has just died, and she has a brother who must be contacted in order for the takeover to proceed. Her mission takes her across Central and Eastern Europe, which gradually leads her to question her own life. The titular Syberia is a mythical island on which mammoths are said to live.\\n\\nThe game starts with Kate arriving in the fictional French village of Valadilène and witnessing the funeral of Anna Voralberg, the owner of a family-owned spring-automaton toy factory. When Kate visits the village notary to finalize the deal, the notary tells her that just before Anna\'s death, the old lady revealed that her brother is not dead and buried, but alive somewhere in the North-East. Now that his sister is dead, Hans Voralberg becomes the new owner of the factory, which cannot be sold without his approval. Kate has no choice: If she wants the takeover to succeed, she will have to find Hans. Kate\'s research reveals that Hans was injured in his attempt to retrieve a prehistoric doll of a man riding a mammoth. It stunted his development, leaving him mentally handicapped, and Hans\' sole goal became to find mammoths to ride as the doll depicts.\\n\\nIn order to find Hans, Kate must take his train: a clockwork locomotive built by his sister at his request. It is manned by Oscar, an animatronic man fond of protocol whom Kate must satisfy to depart. She is forced to dive into Hans\' past to retrieve two items of value to him: the mammoth doll and a clockwork music box.\\n\\nAs she follows Hans\' path, Kate makes her way to Barrockstadt, a failing university whose train station acts as a botanical garden. The train stops short of the winding mechanism so Kate must barter with a nearby couple with a barge. They insist on being paid $100 for their assistance, so Kate has to fix the university\'s broken bandstand to get the university\'s stubborn board of directors to help. Along the way, she gets a lesson on the legend of Syberia and the customs of the mysterious prehistoric Youkol people who lived with mammoths and were able to domesticate them. Before she can leave Barrockstadt entirely, she must pass the large wall that keeps her train from exiting.\\n\\nThe next stop is Komkolzgrad, a dusty Communist-era industrial mining complex with two giant metallic worker-automata overlooking the tracks. The place is run by the eccentric and somewhat crazy Serguei Borodine, who steals Oscar\'s hands to make his automaton organist work. He intends to construct the biggest stage possible for Helena Romanski, a washed-up opera singer with whom he is obsessed. Kate has little choice but to fetch her from a nearby spa in Aralbad on his behalf. Serguei directs Kate to the adjacent cosmodrome for transportation.\\n\\nAt the cosmodrome, Kate meets former test pilot Boris, a drunk who dreams of flying into space on a \\"flying wing\\" invented by Hans. After some sobering up, he teaches Kate how to operate an old airship in exchange for her help in making the flying wing functional. He also warns Kate not to trust Serguei. Once Boris is launched, she uses his advice to launch the airship and leaves for Aralbad.\\n\\nAt the Aralbad spa, Kate meets Helena after getting past the manager. The elderly lady believes she is too old to sing, having lost her legendary voice, which could break glass. With a special cocktail mixed at the bar and a wine glass, Kate convinces Helena that she can still sing. Helena agrees to go with Kate.\\n\\nThe performance in Komkolzgrad does not go quite as planned: beautiful though Helena\'s voice may be (she sings \\"Dark Eyes\\"), it doesn\'t stop Serguei from imprisoning her, as he wants to keep Helena at his side as his personal opera singer. Kate is able to free Helena and take back Oscar\'s hands, but Serguei isn\'t quite willing to give up without a fight, using the worker-automata to block the train. Some spare dynamite dispatches that problem, and Kate brings Helena back to Aralbad. Surprisingly, none other than Hans Voralberg is waiting there at the spa, delighted that Kate brought him his train and Oscar. Hans shows little concern for his sister\'s death and signs the factory release papers without even reading them. He offers to take Kate along, but she initially refuses. However, as she is about to board a plane to fly back to New York, she changes her mind and hops on board the train at the last second, abandoning her job and her unfaithful fiancé back home to help an old man realize his dream.","summary":"Syberia is a 2002 computer adventure game designed by Benoît.

While Ava remains in cyrogenic slumber, the other team members are woken and travel to the moon to set up their base and begin conducting their studies, with Ava scheduled to wake once the base is completed. Sometime later, Ava is awoken by the Technical Operations Machine (T.O.M.), an artificial intelligence that monitors the project. T.O.M. tells Ava that her crewmates are in danger and she needs to go down there to help them out. She quickly sets out in a lander and enters the base on Europa. T.O.M. quickly recognizes that the base\'s internal configuration has changed from their records, whereby to progress further into the complex, Ava must complete various tests (designed as the puzzles in game).\\n\\nAs Ava gets deeper in the complex, T.O.M. determines some of the team members are already dead and the others need their help, urging Ava to move faster. As the tests get harder, T.O.M. realizes that these are designed to be solved by a combination of human and artificial intelligence, a manner similar to that of the actual Turing test.\\n\\nThey enter an area where one of the remaining crew-members, Sarah, warns Ava over the communication systems that she is actually being controlled by T.O.M. due to a special chip implanted in her hand when they left for the mission. Sarah directs Ava to a Faraday cage, which temporarily frees Ava of the control from T.O.M. However, T.O.M. manages to convince Ava that the two of them need to continue to work together to save their colleagues. Though angered by the intrusion of T.O.M. into her body, Ava continues onward.\\n\\nT.O.M. eventually reveals that the Europa ground team had found a microorganism within the depths of the moon that could be used to infinitely regenerate DNA; this could potentially make humans immortal, but also infinitely regenerate bacteria and viruses. When ISA learned of this discovery, they ordered T.O.M. to take whatever actions needed to make sure the Europa team could never return to Earth, initially by taking actions such as trying to starve them to death or lock them outside the base, but eventually by using the hand chip implants to control them. The surface crew realized they were being controlled, and those that did not die from T.O.M.\'s actions found a way to rid the chip from their body, including in one case severing their entire arm. With no way to control the Europa crew, ISA ordered T.O.M. to wake Ava and send her to prevent the others from returning.\\n\\nEventually completing the last of the tests set up by the surface crew, Ava finds Sarah in person, and she offers to remove the hand chip from Ava; Ava agrees. The two realize the only way to get off Europa is to stop T.O.M. and they begin to disable his databases. At this point, the player takes control of T.O.M. and one of his sentry weapons, which they can either use to kill Sarah and Ava, assuring that the organism will never leave Europa, or do nothing, eventually leading to the end of T.O.M. and allowing Ava and Sarah to escape.","summary":"The Turing Test is a first person puzzler that explores the phenomena of consciousness and challenges the meaning of human intuition.

The hero finds centaurs, harpies, automatons, spiders and scorpions, yetis, undead soldiers and other such monsters derived from myth, relentlessly guarding the way and trying to prevent him from reaching the next village or town. The hero must occasionally face stronger \'miniboss\' monsters, usually as part of a side quest. Bosses also appear at intervals generally guarding a main quest item, transportation device, quest NPC, etc. The player faces a boss enemy (called telkines) at the end of each \'act\' (Greece, Egypt and The Orient) and faces a final boss enemy at Mount Olympus, the Titan Typhon.","summary":"Titan Quest is an action role playing hack and slash video game developed by Iron Lore Entertainment.

These artifacts are known as the \\"numenera\\" and represent what is left of the science and technology of these past civilizations. Many of them are irreparably broken, but some are still able to function in ways that are beyond the level of understanding of most humans, who believe these objects to be magical in nature.\\n\\nThe protagonist of the story, known as the Last Castoff, is the final vessel for the consciousness of an ancient man, who managed to find a way to leave his physical body and be reborn in a new one, thus achieving a kind of immortality by means of the relics. Unknown to him, however, every time he abandoned – or \\"cast off\\" – these host bodies, they awoke with a consciousness of their own, having no memory of their former master or his deeds. The actions of this man, known as the Changing God to some, attracted the enmity of the \\"Angel of Entropy\\", who now seeks to destroy him and his creations. The Last Castoff, being one such \\"creation\\", is also targeted by the Angel, and must find their master before both are undone. To do so, the protagonist must explore the Ninth World, discovering other castoffs, making friends and enemies along the way. One means of such exploration are the \\"Meres\\" – artifacts that let their user gain control over the lives of other castoffs, and experience different worlds or dimensions through them. Through these travels the Last Castoff will leave their mark on the world – their Legacy – and will find an answer to the fundamental question of the story: What does one life matter?","summary":"Torment: Tides of Numenera is a game set in the world of Monte Cook\'s new tabletop RPG setting, Numenera.

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.\\n\\nUntil Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the \\"Butterfly Effect\\" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player\'s choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has \\"hundreds of endings\\". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.\\n\\nThe gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.\\n\\nUntil Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","themes":["Horror","Survival"],"studio":"Supermassive Games","release_date":"2015-08-25","rank":88.5420858063703,"content_descriptions":["Violence","Bad Language","Blood and Gore","Intense Violence","Sexual Themes","Strong Language"]},{"id":7878,"artworks":["arr9a"],"cover":"co2t2v","genres":["Shooter","Adventure","Indie"],"keywords":["zombies","post-apocalyptic","survival","first person shooter","crafting","role playing","cube","steam","online","base building","steam greenlight","digital distribution","unity engine","random loot","permanent death","downloadable content","battleye","electric fence","blow torch"],"name":"Unturned","player_perspectives":["First person","Third person","Virtual Reality"],"summary":"Fast! you must find some resources to survive! explore the towns, kill some zombies, \\"steal\\" cars, food, weapons and gear, collect wood, make your own base, build your farm and keep an eye open!

Four Drifters find themselves chosen to wield the power of the planet\'s spiritual protectors, the Guardians, to stop a prophesied but unknown menace to their world. As they adventure together, they are opposed by other Drifter teams, a trio of fanatical scientists called the Prophets, and the Demons of Filgaian legend. The four adventurers eventually make startling discoveries about their world\'s true history, and their personal connections to it.","summary":"The first two games in the Wild Arms series garnered attention and acclaim as they brought classic console role-playing to the original PlayStation. Though crafted in the same story-telling spirit, Wild Arms 3 (titled Wild Arms Advanced 3rd in Japan) boasts major technological improvements and a number of new gameplay elements. Featuring \\"stroke-shaded\\" animation-style graphics, a \\"Wild West\\" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the PlayStation 2.\\n\\nWild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them. The \\"drifters\\" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work.\\n\\nAs the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts of the game\'s complex puzzles. A technique dubbed \\"expressive communication\\" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair.\\n\\nWild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons & a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles. Wild Arms 3 embodies tried-and-true elements of a role-playing classic.","themes":["Fantasy"],"studio":"Media.Vision","release_date":"2002-03-14","rank":78.2468570198621,"content_descriptions":["Mild Violence"]},{"id":25675,"artworks":["ar9ex"],"collection":"Wild Guns","cover":"co23qm","genres":["Shooter","Arcade"],"keywords":["western","shooting gallery","steampunk","remake","wild west","shooter","multiple protagonists","e3 2017","gun","e3 2016"],"name":"Wild Guns Reloaded","player_perspectives":["Side view"],"storyline":"\\"Annie has tracked down the famed bounty hunter Clint to get revenge on the Kid gang.\\"","summary":"\\"Wild Guns Reloaded\\" is a fast paced gallery style shooter mixing the Wild West with steampunk.
